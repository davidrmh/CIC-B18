After transaction costs, the rules do not earn consistent excess returns over a simple buy-and-hold strategy in the out-of-sample test periods. The rules are able to identify periods to be in the index when daily returns are positive and volatility is low and out when the reverse is true. These latter results can largely be explained by low-order serial correlation in stock index returns.},

abstract = {Technical analysis is aimed at devising trading rules capable of exploiting short-term fluctuations on the financial markets. Recent results indicate that this market timing approach may be a viable alternative to the buy-and-hold approach, where the assets are kept over a relatively long time period. In this paper, we propose genetic programming as a means to automatically generate such short-term trading rules on the stock markets. Rather than using a composite stock index for this purpose, the trading rules are adjusted to individual stocks. Computational results, based on historical pricing and transaction volume data, are reported for 14 Canadian companies listed on the Toronto stock exchange market. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper describes a new pattern discovery approach based on the combination among rules between Perceptually Important Points (PIPs) and the Symbolic Aggregate approximation (SAX) representation op- timised by Genetic Algorithm (GA). The rules and SAX are used to represent the financial time series in order to efficiently identify patterns. The GA is used to generate investment rules and find optimal so- lutions. We decided to call this new approach Symbolic Important Rules (SIR). The proposed approach was tested with real data from the S{\&}P500 index and all the results obtained outperform the Buy{\&}Hold strategy. Three different case studies are presented. With this approach it was possible to obtain in the period 2011â€“2014 a total return of 76.7{\%}, which outperformed the Buy{\&}Hold strategy (61.9{\%}).},

@article{Kampouridis2017,
abstract = {The majority of forecasting methods use a physical time scale for studying price fluctuations of financial markets, making the flow of physical time discontinuous. Therefore, using a physical time scale may expose companies to risks, due to ignorance of some significant activities. In this paper, an alternative and original approach is explored to capture important activities in the market. The main idea is to use an event-based time scale based on a new way of summarising data, called Directional Changes. Combined with a genetic algorithm, the proposed approach aims to find a trading strategy that maximises profitability in foreign exchange markets. In order to evaluate its efficiency and robustness, we run rigorous experiments on 255 datasets from six different currency pairs, consisting of intra-day data from the foreign exchange spot market. The results from these experiments indicate that our proposed approach is able to generate new and profitable trading strategies, significantly outperforming other traditional types of trading strategies, such as technical analysis and buy and hold.},

@article{Huang2015,
abstract = {Technical analysis with numerous indicators and patterns has been regarded as important evidence for making trading decisions in financial markets. However, it is extremely difficult for investors to find useful trading rules based on numerous technical indicators. This paper innovatively proposes the use of biclustering mining to discover effective technical trading patterns that contain a combination of indicators from historical financial data series. This is the first attempt to use biclustering algorithm on trading data. The mined patterns are regarded as trading rules and can be classified as three trading actions (i.e., the buy, the sell, and no-action signals) with respect to the maximum support. A modified K nearest neighborhood ( K -NN) method is applied to classification of trading days in the testing period. The proposed method [called biclustering algorithm and the K nearest neighbor (BIC- K -NN)] was implemented on four historical datasets and the average performance was compared with the conventional buy-and-hold strategy and three previously reported intelligent trading systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed trading system outperforms its counterparts and will be useful for investment in various financial markets.},

@article{Zhang2015,
abstract = {Quantitative investment (QI) is certainly a hot topic in big data analysis. For knowledge discovery in huge, complex and nonlinear stock market data, the eXtended Classifier Systems (XCS) is quite suitable because of the excellent learning and explicit expression abilities derived from its intrinsic techniques that include classification rule mining, evolutionary learning and reinforcement learning. This paper presents an Evolutionary Trend Reversion Model (eTrendRev), which is based on the proposed XCS with learn mode (XCSL) and trend-reversion strategy. The eTrendRev is highlighted in three aspects: (1) the explicit rules generated by XCSL are more understandable than black-box models, such as neural networks, thus can provide justifiable knowledge to guide trading; (2) the original pure explore mode of XCS is substituted by the proposed learn mode, which is shown in this study to perform better and is more stable; (3) a variety of trend-reversion strategies are integrated and made dynamic through evolutionary learning. For model evaluation, experiments were carried out on the historical data of the Shanghai Composite Index and the NASDAQ Composite Index, and back-testing results indicate that eTrendRev can produce higher return with lower risk and recognize significant market turning points in a timely fashion. This study also confirms the profitability of using sole trend-reversion indicators in machine learning-based QI model.},
